Tell me about your project.”

You could say:

“I built a console-based Bank Account Management System using Core Java and OOP. It supports creating savings and current accounts, depositing and withdrawing money, and logging transactions. I used inheritance and polymorphism to create flexible account types, and used Java collections like HashMap and ArrayList to store account and transaction data.”

✅ Q1. Can you briefly explain your Bank Account Management System project?
Answer:

This is a console-based Java application that allows users to manage bank accounts. Users can create accounts (Savings or Current), deposit and withdraw money, and view transaction history. I used object-oriented programming concepts like abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation to structure the code effectively.

Explanation:

Give a short summary of the features and technical concepts used.

Highlight it's object-oriented and uses Java collections.

Q2. Why did you use an abstract class for Account?
Answer:

I used an abstract class because Account represents a general concept of a bank account. I wanted to provide common properties and methods like accountNumber, balance, and deposit() but leave the withdraw() method abstract so each account type (Savings or Current) could implement it differently.

Explanation:

Abstract classes are used when:

You want to share common code.

You need different implementations of a method (withdraw()).

✅ Q3. What OOP principles did you use in this project?
Answer:

I used all four OOP principles:

Encapsulation: Fields are private or protected with getters/setters.

Inheritance: SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount inherit from Account.

Abstraction: Account is abstract and cannot be directly instantiated.

Polymorphism: withdraw() method is overridden with different behavior in subclasses.

Explanation:

Be clear and confident when mapping features to OOP terms.

✅ Q4. Why did you use HashMap and ArrayList?
Answer:

I used a HashMap to store accounts because each account has a unique account number, which works well as a key. It gives constant-time lookup. I used an ArrayList to store transactions since I needed to maintain the order in which transactions happened.

Explanation:

HashMap<String, Account> → Fast access by account number.

ArrayList<Transaction> → Maintains insertion order.

✅ Q5. How would you extend this project to add file storage?
Answer:

I would use Java File I/O to write account and transaction data to .txt or .csv files when the application exits and read it back at startup. For more structure, I could use ObjectOutputStream and ObjectInputStream to serialize the objects.

Explanation:

Show you understand serialization and file persistence.

💡 SECTION 2: Java Concepts from the Project
✅ Q6. What’s the difference between an abstract class and an interface? Why use an abstract class here?
Answer:

Abstract classes can have both implemented and abstract methods.

Interfaces (prior to Java 8) could only have abstract methods.

In this project, I used an abstract class because I wanted to provide a default deposit() method and keep withdraw() abstract.

Explanation:

You're showing understanding of when to use what.

✅ Q7. How is polymorphism used in your project?
Answer:

I used runtime polymorphism. The Bank class stores Account references, but at runtime, the actual object could be a SavingsAccount or CurrentAccount. So when calling withdraw(), the method that's actually executed depends on the object type.

Explanation:

Account acc = new SavingsAccount(...);

acc.withdraw(1000); → Dynamic method dispatch

✅ Q8. What happens if you try to withdraw more than allowed?
Answer:

The overridden withdraw() method in SavingsAccount checks if the balance after withdrawal will fall below ₹500. If it does, it prints an error message. Similarly, the CurrentAccount class allows overdraft up to ₹-10,000.

Explanation:

You're showing that you handled business logic using polymorphism.

🔐 SECTION 3: Behavioral / Resume Fit Questions
✅ Q9. What challenges did you face during this project?
Answer:

One challenge was designing the inheritance structure correctly — choosing which behaviors to put in the base class vs. the child classes. I also initially used lists to store accounts, but then realized using a HashMap would be more efficient for lookups.

Explanation:

Mentioning small but thoughtful decisions impresses interviewers.

✅ Q10. If we gave you time, how would you improve this project?
Answer:

Add login/authentication using PINs

Implement file-based storage using serialization

Add a GUI using JavaFX or Swing

Make it multi-user with a menu per user

Use unit testing (JUnit) for verifying features

Explanation:

Shows you're capable of thinking beyond the assignment.

📁 Files Included:
Main.java – the entry point

Account.java – the abstract parent class (base for all accounts)

SavingsAccount.java – child of Account

CurrentAccount.java – child of Account

Transaction.java – a record for each action

Bank.java – controller class managing accounts & transactions

🔍 FILE EXPLANATIONS
1. Main.java — 🚀 Starts the application


public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // App logic starts here
    }
}

Acts as the driver class.

Displays menu to user.

Takes user input via Scanner.

Calls methods from the Bank class to perform actions.

Demonstrates control flow and how your objects interact.

🔁 You only ever run this file directly.

2. Account.java — 🧱 Abstract base class for all account types

public abstract class Account {
    protected String accountNumber;
    protected String holderName;
    protected double balance;

    public abstract void withdraw(double amount);  // Abstract method
}
Represents a general bank account (template).

Declares shared fields: accountNumber, holderName, balance

Implements encapsulation (fields are protected)

Declares withdraw() as an abstract method, so child classes must implement their own withdrawal logic.

🔑 OOP Concepts Used:

Abstraction (class is abstract, cannot be directly used)

Encapsulation (fields protected, accessed via methods)

Polymorphism (child classes override withdraw())

3. SavingsAccount.java — 💰 Represents a savings account


public class SavingsAccount extends Account {
    @Override
    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        // Withdraw only if min balance is maintained
    }
}
Subclass of Account

Enforces a minimum balance

Overrides the withdraw() method with savings-specific rules

🔑 OOP Concepts Used:

Inheritance (inherits from Account)

Polymorphism (custom withdraw() behavior)

4. CurrentAccount.java — 🏦 Represents a current account


public class CurrentAccount extends Account {
    @Override
    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        // Allows overdraft up to a limit
    }
}
Also a subclass of Account

Allows withdrawal even if it leads to negative balance, within overdraft limits

Provides its own withdraw() logic

🔑 OOP Concepts Used:

Same as SavingsAccount: Inheritance + Polymorphism

5. Transaction.java — 📄 Represents a single deposit/withdraw action


public class Transaction {
    private String accountNumber;
    private String type; // "Deposit" or "Withdrawal"
    private double amount;
    private LocalDateTime date;
}

A simple data class for logging actions

Stores the account number, type, amount, and timestamp

You could extend this later to export to files, generate reports, etc.

🔑 OOP: Simple class with encapsulation

6. Bank.java — 🧠 Brain of the system — manages everything


public class Bank {
    private Map<String, Account> accounts = new HashMap<>();
    private List<Transaction> transactions = new ArrayList<>();
}

Stores accounts in a HashMap (for fast lookup)

Stores transactions in a List

Has all logic to:

Create accounts

Deposit/withdraw

Show account info

Show transaction logs

🔑 OOP Concepts Used:

Encapsulation: accounts and transactions are private

Aggregation: Bank has-a list of accounts and transactions

Abstraction: Hides implementation from Main
